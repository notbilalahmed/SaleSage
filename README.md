# SaleSage

I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, SalesAge! This project features a machine learning model based on Random Forest Regressor, designed to predict sales with an accuracy of 59% using the Big Mart Sales dataset from Kaggle. The model has a mean absolute error of ±791.457, showcasing its precision in sales prediction. For those interested, the project has already been submitted to Kaggle for reference.
